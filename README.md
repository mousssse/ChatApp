# ProjetJava
This project was developed by Sandro Chalhoub and Sarah Mousset. It's a decentralized multi-user chat application that operates on local networks.

## Sources and build
```
git clone https://github.com/mousssse/ProjetJava.git
```
Maven was used as the build automation tool; all dependencies are included in the pom.xml file.

## Run
In order to run the application, run the ChatApp class with Maven with the following goals: ```clean javafx:run```
For additional information on how to use ChatApp and how it works, refer to our report in the Conception folder of the repository.
We highly recommend activating the "Terminate and relaunch while launching" option in the IDE preferences. In Eclipse, it's in Window > Preferences > Run/Debug > Launching.
