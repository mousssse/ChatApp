# ProjetJava
This project was developed by [Sandro Chalhoub](https://github.com/54ndro18) and [Sarah Mousset](https://github.com/mousssse). It's a decentralized multi-user chat application that operates on local networks.

## Sources and build
```
git clone https://github.com/mousssse/ProjetJava.git
```
Maven was used as the build automation tool; all dependencies are included in the pom.xml file.

## Run
In order to run the application, run the ChatApp class with Maven with the following goals: ```clean javafx:run```
For additional information on how to use ChatApp and how it works, refer to our [report](Final%20report%20and%20user%20manual.pdf) in the Conception folder of the repository.
We highly recommend activating the "Terminate and relaunch while launching" option in the IDE preferences. In Eclipse, it's in Window > Preferences > Run/Debug > Launching.
